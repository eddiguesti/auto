2. **Writes in Their Voice**: AI transforms spoken words into eloquent prose while preserving the user's authentic voice, personality, and writing style.

3. **Creates Printed Books**: Users can order professionally printed hardcover or paperback books through our print-on-demand integration with Lulu.
